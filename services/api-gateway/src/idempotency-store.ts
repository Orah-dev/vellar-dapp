// In-memory Idempotency-Key store (issue #260), matching the existing
// in-memory TokenBucketLimiter pattern in this gateway (token-bucket.ts).
//
// Known limitation, disclosed rather than silently accepted: this is
// per-process state. A multi-instance deployment of api-gateway (more than
// one replica behind a load balancer) would NOT share idempotency records
// across instances, so a retry that happens to land on a different replica
// would not be deduplicated. Fine for the current single-instance
// deployment target; a real production multi-replica deployment needs this
// backed by Redis or another shared store instead. Not built here since
// nothing else in this gateway has a shared-state dependency yet, and adding
// one is a bigger, separate infrastructure decision than this issue's own
// scope.
//
// NOT YET WIRED INTO THE PROXY — see docs/api-versioning.md or the PR body
// for #260 for why: buffering a proxied @fastify/http-proxy response to
// cache it requires intercepting `res.stream` in replyOptions.onResponse,
// and @fastify/http-proxy@11's own type definitions do not type that
// callback or its `res` parameter at all (checked
// node_modules/@fastify/http-proxy/types/index.d.ts directly), so a real
// implementation would be working against an effectively-`any` stream
// object with no compiler safety net, and the actual `undici` dispatch
// handler shape it's built on is not part of this package's exported types
// either. This store class itself is complete and would-be-correct
// dedupe/conflict logic; wiring it into the actual proxy response path is
// left for a follow-up once the stream-interception approach is designed
// and verified against a real @fastify/http-proxy response, not guessed at.
