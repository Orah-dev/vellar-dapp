//! VELA verified-recipient policy: the signer's auth entries may only invoke
//! contracts with a LIVE attestation in the attestation registry — and, in
//! trusted-publishers mode, only attestations attributed to a publisher the
//! wallet owner explicitly trusts.
//!
//! ## What this enforces (exact semantics — state them, don't oversell)
//!
//! Attached as a required co-signer in a signer's `SignerLimits`, or as a
//! standalone policy signer, this policy runs inside the wallet's
//! `__check_auth` and rejects the WHOLE authorization if any
//! `Context::Contract` in the invocation targets a contract that is not
//! currently attested as verified (strict mode) or not attributed to a
//! trusted publisher (trusted-publishers mode). The honest claim is
//! therefore: *a signer constrained by this policy cannot transact THROUGH
//! unverified code* — no fake-token transfers, no calls into unattested
//! contracts.
//!
//! It does NOT verify the human/classic-account recipient of funds (an x402
//! `payTo` is often a G-account with no code to verify — that is the
//! facilitator trust layer's job), and an attestation means REPRODUCIBLE,
//! ATTRIBUTABLE SOURCE PROVENANCE, not audited/benign/safe. A "warn" mode is
//! deliberately NOT a contract concern: a policy either authorizes or it
//! doesn't; warning-but-allowing is a wallet-side (pre-signing) behavior.
//!
//! ## Modes
//!
//! - [`ProvenanceMode::Strict`] — every invoked contract must hold a live
//!   attestation (`registry.is_verified`).
//! - [`ProvenanceMode::TrustedPublishers`] — every invoked contract must hold a
//!   live attestation attributed to one of the configured publisher ids
//!   (`registry.publisher_of`). The set is bounded (`MAX_TRUSTED_PUBLISHERS`)
//!   and immutable; an attestation without attribution never matches.
//!
//! ## Composition, not replacement
//!
//! This policy carries NO spending accounting. It is designed to stack with
//! the spending-limit policies via multi-policy `SignerLimits` (the smart
//! wallet iterates every required co-signer): budget caps how much, this
//! policy caps through-what. Attach both to an agent key for the full claim
//! "bounded spend, verified code only".
//!
//! ## Deny-by-default, fail-closed, bounded
//!
//! Non-contract contexts (deploys etc.) are rejected; the wallet's own admin
//! surface is never authorized; an unverified/expired/unknown contract fails
//! the whole auth; an empty context list authorizes nothing. Each context is
//! parsed explicitly: a `transfer` whose `from` is not the bound wallet is a
//! mismatched authorization context and is rejected. At most `MAX_CONTEXTS`
//! contexts are evaluated per call, with ONE registry read each — bounded
//! work, since `__check_auth` cost is consensus-priced and x402 facilitators
//! re-simulate payments. The policy holds no per-call mutable state, so
//! repeated simulation is trivially idempotent.
//!
//! ## Registry unavailable = fail closed, recover by detaching
//!
//! If the registry contract cannot be reached (archived, wrong network, or
//! simply absent) the cross-contract call traps and the authorization fails.
//! That is the intended fail-closed behavior; the RECOVERY path is the wallet
//! owner's admin passkey removing this policy signer, which the smart wallet
//! allows without consulting the policy (standalone `SignerLimits(None)`
//! attach + the wallet's sole-self-removal exception — security-audit.md V3 /
//! RA-6). This contract never blocks its own removal.
//!
//! ## Immutable configuration (deploy-once)
//!
//! Config (wallet, registry, mode) is written once in `__constructor`, no
//! setters. Repointing the registry or widening the publisher set in-place
//! would let a wallet owner void the guarantee; changing them means a fresh
//! instance and an explicit passkey-approved re-attach.
//!
//! ## Single-tenant binding
//!
//! Each instance is bound at deploy to ONE wallet; `install` and `policy__`
//! reject any other. Same TTL renewal and permissionless-self-clean behavior
//! as the sibling policies.
