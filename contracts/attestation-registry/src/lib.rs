//! VELA attestation registry: the on-chain mirror of the OFF-CHAIN contract
//! verification pipeline, consumed by the verified-recipient policy.
//!
//! ## What this is (and is honestly not)
//!
//! Verification truth lives off-chain — a contract cannot rebuild another
//! contract's source on-chain. This registry is therefore an ORACLE, scoped as
//! narrowly as possible: a single attestor key (held by the verification
//! service) writes time-bounded records of "contract X currently has verified
//! source with wasm hash H". `is_verified` is the one-read view a policy calls
//! inside `__check_auth`.
//!
//! An attestation means REPRODUCIBLE, ATTRIBUTABLE SOURCE PROVENANCE — it does
//! NOT mean audited, benign, or safe. Every consumer of this registry must
//! carry that framing.
//!
//! ## Fail-closed by expiry (silence decays to unverified)
//!
//! Every attestation carries an `expires_ledger`. `is_verified` returns true
//! only while the current ledger is strictly below it, so a verification
//! service that stops re-attesting — or a contract whose re-verification
//! fails — decays to unverified WITHOUT anyone needing to call `revoke`.
//! Revocation exists for the fast path (the attestor sees an upgrade or a
//! failed rebuild and kills the attestation immediately); expiry is the
//! backstop that needs no one's liveness.
//!
//! ## Known limit: upgrade staleness (TOCTOU)
//!
//! Soroban gives contracts no host function to read another contract's current
//! executable wasm hash, so this registry cannot self-check that an attested
//! contract still runs the attested code. A contract upgraded after
//! attestation stays "verified" until the attestor revokes or the record
//! expires. Mitigation is layered off-chain (short expiries, the attestor's
//! upgrade watch, facilitator-side live hash checks at payment time) and the
//! residual window is DOCUMENTED wherever enforcement is claimed — never
//! hidden. The attested `wasm_hash` is stored so off-chain consumers can
//! compare it against the live hash themselves.
//!
//! ## No user funds, no user state
//!
//! The registry holds no funds and stores nothing per-user: one instance-level
//! attestor address, one persistent record per attested contract. Worst-case
//! compromise of the attestor key mis-labels provenance; it cannot move value.
//! The attestor is rotatable (`set_attestor`) by the current attestor.
//!
//! ## Publisher attribution (trusted-publishers policy mode)
//!
//! An attestation may carry a `publisher` id: a 32-byte identifier of WHO the
//! verified source is attributed to, derived off-chain by the attestor from the
//! verification record's canonical source location (e.g. `sha256` of the
//! lower-cased `github.com/<owner>`). The verified-recipient policy's
//! trusted-publishers mode consults it through `publisher_of`, which answers
//! only while the attestation is live — provenance and attribution expire
//! together. `upsert` (no publisher) is kept for attestors that cannot
//! attribute; such attestations are verified but unattributed and never match
//! a trusted-publisher set (deny-by-default).
