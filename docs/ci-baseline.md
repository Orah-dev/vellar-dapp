# CI baseline and the `dev` push gate (#427, #429)

Decision record. `docs/decisions.md` is not tracked in this repository, so the
entry lives here; copy it across if you keep the private log.

## Decision (2026-09-25): fix, then gate

`ci.yml` now runs on pushes to `dev` as well as `main`. It was added **together
with** the fixes below rather than on top of a known-failure list: the red suite
was small enough to fix at the root, and a gate that is red on day one teaches
everyone to ignore it. No test was skipped, deleted or loosened to get here.

## What "red" actually was

Upstream CI had not run the test suite since 2026-09-17. Every run that started a
job failed at the first gate, **Audit dependencies**, so format, typecheck, tests
and build never executed. Many PR runs since 2026-09-24 started **zero jobs**
("likely failed because of a workflow file issue") — `actionlint` passes on
`ci.yml`, identical files produced both outcomes on the same day, so this is on the
GitHub side (Actions settings or billing) and needs a maintainer to check.

Measured locally on `dev` at `484e7b5`, then fixed in this branch:

## Current state (this branch, local)

`pnpm audit --audit-level=high` · `format:check` · `typecheck` (18/18) · `test`
with `CI_REQUIRE_DB=1` (every package green) · `build` · mocked e2e (14/14) —
all pass. The hermetic
build suite (`hermetic-build.yml`) passes against real Docker.

Still skipped, and deliberately not touched here (existing 2026-09-18 decision):
two lifecycle-service and three verification-service route tests that
`paymentMiddleware` makes unreachable from `app.inject()`. `apps/web`'s `test`
script uses POSIX `NODE_OPTIONS=…` syntax, so it fails under `turbo` on Windows
only; CI is Linux.

## How regressions are caught now

- Every push to `dev` and `main`, and every PR, runs the full `ci` job.
- Changes to the worker, the builder image or the contracts also run
  `hermetic-build` (path-filtered, ~15 minutes).
- DB-backed suites fail instead of skipping when Postgres is missing
  (`CI_REQUIRE_DB=1`), so the M7 and budget SQL keep running against a real DB.

## Branch protection (repository settings, not code)

The YAML makes CI **run**; it does not make it **block**. That needs a maintainer
with admin rights, in Settings → Branches (or a ruleset) for `dev` and `main`:

1. Require a pull request before merging.
2. Require status checks to pass: **`ci`**. Do not make `hermetic-build` required
   — it is path-filtered, and a required check that never reports blocks merges.
3. Require branches to be up to date before merging.
4. Include administrators (or record why not).

This also answers V6 fact #2 / M9 in `docs/security-audit.md`: nothing in this
change turns branch protection on, and it has not been verified from here.

## Found while fixing, not changed here

Outside the scope of #427/#429; recorded so they are not lost.

- `processDeploymentJob` (policy-service) deploys without consuming the M2 deploy
  budget. It is not wired into any route or process today; if it is, route it
  through `deployPolicyInstance`, which enforces the budget.
- `registerAdminDLQRoutes` treats every caller as `"default-admin"` when no
  `getAdminUser` is supplied. Also unwired today; wiring it requires a real admin
  identity.
- policy-service signs CSRF tokens with a hard-coded fallback secret when
  `CSRF_SECRET` is unset; production should refuse to boot without one.
- lifecycle-service has an audit-log module but its server takes no audit
  dependency (tests were passing one that was silently ignored).
